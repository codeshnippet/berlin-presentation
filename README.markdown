It is built using [The Spectacle core API](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

## Development

After downloading the boilerplate, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `yarn`. (or `npm install` if you're about that life)

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and we are ready to roll
